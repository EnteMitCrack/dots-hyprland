_[Check the releases](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/releases) for configurations presented in Reddit/Discord posts_. _If you came here for my summer rice, see [summer-gruv branch](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/tree/summer-gruv)_

# Description
- For this branch, there are **2 styles that can be toggled: ( press `Super`+`Alt`+`W`)**
    - osu/material style: Top bar. Uses osu! icons. Some elements try to follow Material Design 3
    - Windows 11 style: Yes you read that correctly. Aimed at fooling people, with convincing animations and blur effect.
- *__Note__: Wallpapers in this repo might not be the same as the preview. You can always find a wallpaper yourself and generate a color scheme using it (Copy it to `~/.config/eww/images/wallpaper/wallpaper` then use the `>wall` command __on the search bar__. If the colors look too chaotic, type `>one` then try `>wall` again. To switch back to that "chaotic" color set, type `>multi` then `>wall`.)*
