    <h3> A polished Linux experience. </h3>
</div>

## Description
- A new approach to the status bar:
  - **Only show what you need.** Does not try to fit everything on the screen at once.
  - **Flexible.** Scrollable modules. Automatically scrolls to notifications module when there's a new one. Bar moves when sidebar is opened.
  - **Funciton AND form.** Floating bar, but you can still click the topmost pixel.
  - **OSDs done right.** Volume and Brightness indicators are shown on the topleft and topright corners. They don't block your windows or other bar components.
- A comfortable experience:
  - Easy on the eyes: uses Material You colors and natural animation curves
  - Random anime girl from 3 public APIs ~~(segs too!)~~
