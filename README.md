# üîß General instructions
 - Don't download the main branch! Use one of the above listed ones.
 - **BACKUP**
 - Install dependencies. You can find the list for them in branch-specific readmes.
 - Copy
   - `.config`, `.local` to home folder
   - Folders in `.local/share/icons` to your `/usr/share/icons`
   - Stuff in `Import manually` folder if you need them
 - **For ARM users**: Compile .cpp files in `.config/eww/scripts/` (to that folder) (like this: `g++ ~/.config/ewwscripts/SCRIPTNAME.cpp -o ~/.config/eww/scripts/SCRIPTNAME`)
 
# üé® eww (yes I've spent too much time on this)
 ## Performance
|  ‚åÑ  | Do use | Not recommended | Notes                 |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Kernel |     | cachyos, xanmod | Don't abuse power savers. Also I'm not sure what the hell I'm saying - this is just from personal experience. |
| Login shell  | bash/zsh | fish | It's okay to use fish in a terminal - that's what I do |

 ## Setup
 - This eww config only works properly in `~/.config/eww`
 - Start eww with `eww daemon`
 - To open top bar: `eww open bar`
 - To open the Windows bar: `eww open winbar` (`windoes`/`hybrid` branch)
 - To open the bottom line: `eww open bottomline` (so that the music window opens if you click the bottom edge of the screen)
 - Open the overview (middle-click workspaces) and wait 10 seconds (for it to generate app search cache, or icons won't show properly)
 ## Usage
 - Music controls: Middle-click for Play/Pause, Right-click for Next track, scroll to change volume
 - To open the Overview, middle/right-click the workspace indicators or run `eww open overview`
 - In overview, type to search apps (see more below)
 ## Search
 - Type normally to search apps
 - Type something beginning with a number and it'll be calculated (`qalc` is used for backend)
 - `>save THEME`: Saves current colorscheme, with THEME as the name.
 - `>load THEME`: Loads a saved theme. Available themes will be shown as you type.
 - `>music`: Get colorscheme from current media thumbnail
 - `>wall`: Get colorscheme from wallpaper located in `~/.config/eww/images/wallpaper/wallpaper` (might take quite a while)
 - `>light`: Remember to use light mode for next color generations
 - `>dark`: Remember to use dark mode for next color generations
 - `>one`: Remember to use only one color for bar icons for next color generations
 - `>multi`: Remember to use many colors for bar icons for next color generations
 - `>r`: Reload (kills and relaunches eww with the default bar)

# üôè Attribution
 - Thank you fufexan (who also thanks a lot more people) for his guidance and a simple, clean [eww config](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles) (good start for learning eww on hyprland btw)
 - Thanks to the people at the Hyprland discord server for their inspiration
 - Bing AI for helping me code like 80% of the C++ functions (lmao)
